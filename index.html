											<h1>Transferability in Robotics Workshop</h1>
											<p>@ ICRA 2023, London - 02/06/2023 (Friday) SOUTH GALLERY 23</p>
										</header>
										<p>Transferability in Robotics is a key step to achieving sufficient scale and robustness in order to make robots unambiguous in our everyday lives. The concept of transferability covers a wide range of topics such as i) Embodiment transfer - transferring from one robotic platform to another while considering their different embodiments, ii) Task/skill transfer - transferring methods or capabilities from one task to another, and iii) Knowledge transfer - transferring high-level concepts from one to another. 
										These different areas also have different definitions of transferability and employ different approaches (e.g., representation learning, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, sim2real, interactive learning) for the respective task.
										While each of these fields has made headway in its own right, to really push forward the state of the art in transferability, a combination of contributions from the different fields is needed. The EU Horizon project euRobin aims to achieve transferability by not focusing on any specific sub-category but to share knowledge in a higher/more abstract way. 
										The goal of this workshop is to combine the advances made in the individual fields into a more global picture by facilitating a common understanding of transferability, as well as highlighting contributions and encouraging collaborations between the different areas.

										<h2>Content</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p> The workshop aims to explore different aspects of transferability in robotics, facilitating contributions from a wide range of related fields. It also introduces the vision of the euRobin project on how to tackle transferability to solve meaningful real-world tasks such as robotic manufacturing for a circular economy, Personal Robots for Enhanced QOL and Well-Being as well as Outdoor Robots for Sustainable Communities.
										Specifically, the workshop will focus on, but is not limited to, the following topics in regards to transferability in robotics:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Transferable representations
											</li>
											<li>
												Transfering from simulation to real-world (and vice versa)
											</li>
											<li>
												Task to task transfer (meta-learning and others)
											</li>
											<li>
												Robot (embodiment) to robot transfer
											</li>
											<li>
												Concept to concept transfer
											</li>
											<li>
												Transferability in practice
											</li>

She has more than 10 years of experience in mobile manipulation with physical robots such as the PR2, Tiago, HSR, Turtlebot, LWR, UR and a multitude of simulated robots. The main application areas are everyday actions in a household, mobile pick and place in retail and assembly. Prior to joining Michael Beetz's group in November 2013, she worked for one year as a researcher at Kastanienbaum GmbH, now Franka Emika, led by Sami Haddadin, in tight collaboration with the Robotics and Mechatronics Center of DLR. Gayane has a M.Sc. degree in Informatics with a major in AI and Robotics from the Technical University of Munich and a B.Eng. degree in Informatics with a major in Information Security from the State Engineering University of Armenia.<br>

																<p class='talk-list'>
																<b> Bio:</b> Noémie Jaquier is a postdoctoral researcher at the High Performance Humanoid Technologies Lab (H²T) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany. From
																2016 to 2020, she was a PhD student affiliated to the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland and working at the Idiap Research Institute. She did a six-months PhD sabbatical in the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI) in Germany in 2019. 
																Her research brings a novel Riemannian perspective to robot learning, optimization, and control by leveraging Riemannian geometry as inductive bias and as a theory to provide sound theoretical guarantees. She investigates data-efficient methods that build on geometric spaces and exploit the geometric information naturally arising in robotic data. Her work focuses on skills learning via human demonstrations and adaptation techniques with geometry as a cornerstone. 
																Noémie Jaquier received the best presentation award at the 2019 Conference on Robot
																Learning and her PhD thesis was nominated for the EPFL Asea Brown Boveri Ldt. Award.<br>
